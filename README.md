## Description
Hacksta is an application, where you can do stuff, that an average user can't do! For an example, you can download profile pictures of any user in the whole Instagram-Network, you can generate legally followers and so on (Follower-Rate: Depends! Maybe 3-5 Followers in 3 Minutes)... Hacksta is available for Windows and Linux and is written in C# (Windows) and in Linux in Bash and Python. 

## NOTE
We, Turksat46 and Fadester, are not responsible, if you cause damage or get in any kind of complications in/on Instagram with using Hacksta. We are only writing/programming/uploading this as a project of making features available without using Instagrams official API! 
Use with care and do not blame us, if something went wrong. YOU are using Hacksta!
